Q1:
As in linear regression / classification, the basis functions are used to learn the process behind the distribution of the data.

Q2:
The amount of hidden layers.

Q3:
In the case when the NN is used for classification.

Q4:
By propagating the residual from the output to the hidden layer(s) below.

Q5:
Stochastic:
+ No further separation of training data needed.
- Costly: weight adaptation for each sample separately.

Batch:
+ Efficiency
- Selection of mini-batch must be done right (randomly)

Q6:
Around update 50, before the validation error starts increasing much. Although the error on the training set still decreases, one is running the risk of overfitting.
