Q1:
Overfitting.

Q2:
Computing the maximum likelihood / MAP value simplifies to the minimization of the sum of squared errors.

Q3:
That the datapoint amount is rather low and the weight parameter variance could be high when regressing.

Q4:
Kernels help us calculate regression just with dual parameters (scale sub-exponentially with number of training samples) instead of weights of basis functions (scale expontentially with dimensions).

Q5:
The computation of eigenvalues and -vectors of the corresponding Gram matrix in order to check its positive semi-definiteness.
