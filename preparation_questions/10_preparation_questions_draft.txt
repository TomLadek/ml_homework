Q1:
EM needs some fixed posterior for the latent space which is then iteratively improved. In VAE, a NN learns the post. based only on the input

Q2:
A correct posterior makes data meaningless. Data can be recovered by sampling from the distribution of the latent variables. In other words, latent variables contain the true (essential) information.

Q3:
Convergence - does the algorithm result in a local/global optimum?
Initialization - number of (hyper) parameters.
Step size.

Q4:
In (i) the latent space contains only variations of pre-determined factors (i.e. digits 0-9, but no translation/rotation).
(ii)'s latent space contains all combinations of all possible factors.
