To get around having to compute the inverse and determinant of the covariance matrix.

Q2:
That the shape will take a form of an ellipsoid.

Q3:
I don't know anything about this.

Q4:
The uniform distribution has the highest entropy only for discrete random variables. A continuous random variable can be interpreted as a composition of infinitely many discrete (and i.i.d.) random variables and by the central limit theorem, the composed RV is a Gaussian.

Q5:
The simple empirical mean / covariance.
