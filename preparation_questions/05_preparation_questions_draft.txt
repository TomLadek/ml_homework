Q1:
So we can transform the input data into a space where the data is linearly separable.

Q2:
By using a suitable basis function, a dimension can be chosen in which the classes have maximum separation and separating them linearly will get easier.

Q3:
Because its output isn't a (set of) continuous variable(s), it's only the probability of a point being classified as a specific class.

Q4:
How sensitive it is to outliers in the data (both correct and incorrect).

Q5:
That it's not convex.

Q6:
To make predictions about the classification of data that is yet to be collected.
