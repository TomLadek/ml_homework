Q1:
Generally there is no data for a better guess and also m(x) = 0 can be achieved anyway by normalizing the data.

Q2:
K (rather than K^-1) has an intuitive interpretation: how similar two inputs are (and therefore also their function values).

Q3:
The covariance matrix grows quadratically with the number of inputs and inverting large matrices is costly. Also data storage.

Q4:
Large scale length. It increases the influence of nearby points so the possible function value space gets narrower -> overfitting.
